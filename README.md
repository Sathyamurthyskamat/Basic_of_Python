>>> print(number)
...
Enter number/Float/String: 2 #Interger Example 2
2
Enter number/Float/String: 3.142 #Interger Example 3.142(pie)
3.142
Enter number/Float/String: sathyamurthy #Interger Example 'Your name'
sathyamurthy
```
### 3. Python Can Use as Calculator
```py
>>> print(5+8) # Adds 5 and 8
...
13.0
>>> print(18/9) # Divides 18 by 9
...
2.0
>>> print(2*60) # Multiplies 2 and 60
...
120.0
>>> print(5-2) # Subtracts 2 from 5
...
3.0
>>> print(((((2500/5)-30)/10)*2)+30) # All operation in one equation
...
124.0
>>> print(4**3) # Elevates 4 to the power of 3. For non integer values of 3, this becomes a root (i.e. 4**(1/2) is the square root of 4)
...
64.0
>>> print(11 % 5) # The remainder part of the integer division of 11 by 5
...
1.0
```
